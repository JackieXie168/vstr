 These are all examples of how you can use the Vstr library, they are often
centered around IO (as that's the main design of the library) but some show
features like custom formatters.
 They all require a POSIX like environment ... although the library should
happily work on win32 etc.

 All code in this dir. is also under the LGPL, not the GPL.
