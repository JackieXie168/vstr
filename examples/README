 These are all examples of how you can use the Vstr library, they are often
centered around IO (as that's the main design of the library) but some show
features like custom formatters.
 They all require a POSIX like environment ... although the library should
happily work on win32 etc.

 All code in this dir. is also under the LGPL, not the GPL.

	condrestart doesn't work?

	jhttpd -> vstr-httpd
	O(1) timer_q_add_node
	Multi procs "cntl list" command pass through
	max timeout for keep-alive
	max requests for keep-alive?
	conf
	 Per file temp/perm directs (301/path or 307/path FS trees? -- and 302?)
	  Allow 410 also? [w3/chips]
	 Per file mime_type ... allow "cool URIs" [w3/chips]
	 Per file extra headers: Content-Location; Content-Md5; 
                                 Cache-Control; etc. [w3/chips]
	 404 pages (and other return codes)
        mmap cache?

  cleanups

	move cl_timer_con() into evnt ?

    BUGS?
	GMT time convertion isn't done ... fuck the broken apps.
	CRLF should be done as (CR)?LF ... fuck the broken apps. Although we
       make sure things doing that can't get screwed by response splitting on
       host or request.
