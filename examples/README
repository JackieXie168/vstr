 These are all examples of how you can use the Vstr library, they are often
centered around IO (as that's the main design of the library) but some show
features like custom formatters.
 They all require a POSIX like environment ... although the library should
happily work on win32 etc.

 All code in this dir. is also under the LGPL, not the GPL.

	allow groups, make Evnt smaller (moveout cb's/conf to group data)

 ex_sock_filter
	All asm calls should have names

	Child dies in --procs, when sent SIGCONT after SIGTSTP or SIGSTOP
	Allow POST without data?

	 Support accept/accept-language per file [w3/chips]
           GALEON

	 Per file temp/perm directs (301/path or 307/path FS trees? -- and 302?)
	  Allow 410 also? [w3/chips]

         Allow custom error code pages, start with 404
	man page
	mime_types speed, by having explicit filename/ext matches
        limiting IO
	  easyish to do globally, not possible other wise until conf. done
	    not to easy to do multi proc. ... need to pass data/connections
	max timeout for keep-alive
	max requests for keep-alive?
	Check config, Ie. --dir-filename="foo bar"
	jhttpd -> vstr-httpd?

	FreeBSD sendfile
	FreeBSD kqueue

    BUGS?
	GMT time convertion isn't done ... fuck the broken apps.
	CRLF should be done as (CR)?LF ... fuck the broken apps. Although we
       make sure things doing that can't get screwed by response splitting on
       host or request.

  tst

	LFS
	half response splitting requests
	mtime in future
	too many clients
	getopt:
		daemon, chroot, drop-privs
