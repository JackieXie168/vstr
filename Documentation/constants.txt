Section: Constants for initialisation in debuging mode

Constant: VSTR_DEBUG_INIT_BASE

 Explanation:

  This is the value that static (Vstr_base) structs need to be initialised
 to when in debugging mode.

 Note:

  In non-debugging mode this value is all 0's, so this won't do anything
 different from just declaring your structs as static.
  The library will also re-initialise the base back to it's correct form before
 returning from timer_q_del_base, so you just need to set it up correctly the
 first time.


Section: Constants passed to vstr_add_vstr()
