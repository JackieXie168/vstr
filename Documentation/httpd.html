    <h1>HTTPD using Vstr</h1>

<a href="examples/ex_httpd.c.html">See the source here.</a>

<pre>
    Simple. Secure.

    Design is somewhat like thttpd.

    Uses the following system utilities:
     poll or epoll, multiplexing
     multiple procs. for MP systems
     sendfile or mmap, for file contents
     LFS
     TCP_CORK
     DEFER_ACCEPT
     chroot, privilage de-escalation (can easily be started as non-root)
       Can be run in "public only" mode.
     socket filters
     IP binding

    Is HTTP/1.1 compliant, as far as I know.
    Supports optional HTTP/1.1 features:
     0.9 HTTP compatability support
     keep-alive, on by default for 1.1 and 1.0
     virtual hosts (via. prefix directories)
     if-modified-since/if-unmodified-since
     single byte ranges, if-range
     accept-encoding/content-encoding for gzip (via. pre-generated files)

    /etc/mime.types file
      plus extensions for disallowing certain file types.

    includes init.d file, and allows "local controller" connections for soft
    restarts etc.

    Converter to make log files that look like apache-httpd combined log files.

    DOES NOT:
      Auto generate directory listings (see ex_dir_list2html in Vstr examples)

      SSI, or other file contents parsing (see ex_ssi in Vstr examples)

      Run programs (doesn't call exec at all, only calls fork() at startup
                    for MP systems).

      Call any NSS or i18n libc functions (this does allow it to be compiled
                                           statically).

      Have a configuration file (will be fixed).

      Have a native ACL configuration (will be fixed, can use socket filters).
