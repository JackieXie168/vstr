    <h1>Vstr design</h1>

    <h2> Requirements </h2>

    <p>
      The Vstr stirng library is designed to be as fast as possible for
      doing IO, specifically non-blocking IO over network connections -- and 
      even more specifically when you are doing that non-blocking IO for
      <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">large numbers of network connections</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This meant that I wanted an API that would:
    <ul>
      <li> append data to the string (Eg. via. a read() from a socket) in as
	close to constant time as possible.
      </li>

      <li> delete data from the begining of the string (Eg. a write() to a 
	socket) in as close to constant time as possible. </li>

      <li> not waste large amounts of memory on each connection.</li>

      <li> call malloc() rarely on active connections.</li>

      <li> support for mmap() data and out of
      bound data (Ie. calling sendfile() but with the head and tail of the
      connection in a string).</li>

      <li>
	Support for having "network strings" in the default C locale, and user
	strings in whatever locale the user wanted.
      </li>

      <li>
	Have all the other "string like API" abilities, (ie. comparison, 
	searching, parsing and formated output).
      </li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2> Implementation </h2>

    <p>
      To make the append/delete case very fast, the internal design uses an 
      ordered set of nodes. Each node has some data and a length. 
      Each string is associated with a configuration, which stores the size of
      the modifiable data nodes. Thus to append data to the string,
      you can either use the remaining amount of space in the last data 
      node (assuming it's writeable) or append a new writable 
      data node. The configuration also has a set of spare data nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes the worst case cost, for append, to be allocation for enough
      nodes of storage to cover the amount needed to be added to the
      string. The worst case cost, for delete from the begining, to be
      a movement from the begining of the set of the string to the spare set
      in the configuration. However after a delete from a string using a 
      configuration, another string using that same configuration will have
      spare data and so not need to do allocation for that amount, so the worst
      case behaviour for append tends to towards never happening.
    </p>

    <p>
      To deal with mmap() areas, a node can be of a non-writeable type. The two
      main ones being a pointer to some external data and a reference to some
      external data (the reference has a cleanup function called on it, when 
      the reference count reaches zero).
    </p>

    <p>
      To deal with out of bound data, a node can be of a non-data type. This 
      means that there is a specified length of data, but no pointer to said 
      data.
    </p>

    <h2> visual data </h2>
    <p>
      There is a simple diagram of the 
      <a href="internal_structure.dia">internal structure</a> discussed above.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a <a href="size_cmp.gnumeric">size analysis</a> of a 
      Vstr string as data is added to it, note that this assumes only
      writeable nodes.
    </p>
