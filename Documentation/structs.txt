Section: the Vstr_ref struct

Member: func

 Explanation:

  This is the cleanup function to be called when noone wants a reference to the
 memory help by the reference anymore.

 Note:

  This function should free() the memory accociated with the reference struct
 itself, if that is required.


Member: ptr

 Explanation:

  This is a ptr to a block of memory.


Member: ref

 Explanation:

  When this reaches the value 0, you are free to call the func member.

 Note:

  It is safest to only change this by calling either vstr_ref_add_ref() or
 vstr_ref_del_ref(). These will automatically call the cleanup function when
 the reference reaches zero.
