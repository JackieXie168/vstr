. vstr_add_fmt()
  floating point relies on the underlying implimentation -- this is very bad.

. bunch of the _rev functions don't have a fast path.

. doco.

. pkg-config as well/instead of gnome-config

. size overflows, just don't do it (tm).

. vstr_conv_node_type -- Ie. vstr_add_vstr(..., _BUF_REF) without the copy ?
                         Also allow conv. REF/PTR to BUF nodes ?

. Make the vstr__netstr2_num_len value constant.

. More locale related stuff, incl. vstr_loc_ functions for cmp/srch/etc.

. Max and Min ammounts for spare nodes.
  min = when allocating a node actually do MAX(1, min_ammount - cur_ammount)
  max = when deleting a node actually do MAX(cur_ammount - max_ammount, 1)

. Size of Vstr_base/Vstr_node
  base = 32 bytes could be 24
         (used becomes short and part of bitflags [4];
          num disappears ? ... becomes part of iovec ? [4]).
  node = 12 could be 8 + (conf->buf_sz for buf;
                          4 for ptr;
                          8 for ref)
         (len becomes part of bitflags).
         making it smaller would also require spliting large ptr/ref's up.

. Allow conf to say don't allocate a cache.

. Make const string a object, so you can share a Vstr between multiple const
objects.
   struct Vstr_const_base { Vstr_base *base; size_t pos; size_t len }; ??

. Add some way to include system headers.

. Cache reg./unreg.
