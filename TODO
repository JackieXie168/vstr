. bunch of the _rev functions don't have a fast path.

. More locale related stuff, incl. vstr_loc_ functions for cmp/srch/etc.

. Max and Min ammounts for spare nodes.
  min = when allocating a node actually do MAX(1, min_ammount - cur_ammount)
  max = when deleting a node actually do MAX(cur_ammount - max_ammount, 1)

. Size of Vstr_base
  base = 24 bytes could be 20
         (num disappears ? ... becomes part of iovec ? [4]).

. Allow conf to say don't allocate a cache.

. Optionaly use Timer_q to delete old cache entries ?

. vstr_conv_encode_qp (quoted printable rfc2045.txt)

. only using _NON and _BUF nodes flag for sub functions optomisation.
